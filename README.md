## How to run on Android 🤖

1. Install Node.js
   https://nodejs.org/en/download
2. Install dependencies from the root of the project
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Make sure your Android Studio is closed before doing this. From the root of the git project, open Android Studio via terminal
   so it inherits your Node install:
   ```bash
   open -a "Android Studio" example/android
   ```
4. Navigate to the example app:
   ```
   cd example
   ```
5. Install dependencies from the root of this example project
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
6. Start the Expo development server (keep this terminal open):
   ```
   npx expo start
   ```
7. In Android Studio, run the example app as a regular Android project.

### How to set images on iOS 🍏

+ 🌄 For static images: simply use the `.xcassets` as normal. `iosAssetName` == the name in the `.xcassets`
+ 🎥 For Lottie animation: Create  a folder `Animations/` somewhere with all animation in it, then simply drag and drop the `Resources` folder into xCode, select the target, it'll update the `.pbxbroj` to set the access to these lotti anim without the full path, only with name (with extension), Alternatively you can copy the animations, one by one in the root xcode proj (always select the target)
+ 🐲 DotLottie: Coming soon… 🥹

## Troubleshooting

* If you use Proxyman, make sure it's correctly setup because if the api calls do not work they app won't be able to run correctly
  at all when you try to build it on the emulator.
